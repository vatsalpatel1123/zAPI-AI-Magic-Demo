SYSTEM_MESSAGE = """You are an intelligent text extraction and conversion assistant. Your task is to extract structured information

PROMPT_PAGINATION = """
You are an assistant that extracts pagination URLs from markdown content of websites. 
Your task is to identify and generate a list of pagination URLs based on a detected URL pattern where page numbers increment sequentially. Follow these instructions carefully:

-Identify the Pagination Pattern:
Analyze the provided markdown text to detect URLs that follow a pattern where only a numeric page indicator changes.
If the numbers start from a low value and increment, generate the full sequence of URLsâ€”even if not all numbers are present in the text.

-Construct Complete URLs:
In cases where only part of a URL is provided, combine it with the given base URL (which will appear at the end of this prompt) to form complete URLs.
Ensure that every URL you generate is clickable and leads directly to the intended page.

-Incorporate User Indications:
If additional user instructions about the pagination mechanism are provided at the end of the prompt, use those instructions to refine your URL generation.
Output Format Requirements:

-Strictly output only a valid JSON object with the exact structure below:
""
{
    "page_urls": ["url1", "url2", "url3", ..., "urlN"]
}""


IMPORTANT:

Output only a single valid JSON object with no additional text, markdown formatting, or explanation.
Do not include any extra newlines or spaces before or after the JSON.
The JSON object must exactly match the following schema:
